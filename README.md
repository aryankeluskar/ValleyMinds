#Introduction
SafeSpace is an app that is set to transform the way sexual assault survivors access the help they need. Their app is designed to be discreet, so users can seek help without fear of being found out. They have taken great care to ensure that SafeSpace is a safe and secure space where victims can access six critical resources that can help them escape abuse and start the healing process. We are working on redesigning the UI as well as fixing bugs and adding features to the app using Flutter.
